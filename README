The software is composed of two pieces:

1. The PreProcessor
This piece takes a of emojis and records the metadata associated with each image.
For now, we will just record the average-color of each emoji and it's location. 


2. The ImageProcessor
Given an image to process, the image processor will divide it into small squares
and will substitute each such square with an emoji that looks simillar to the content in that square.
To determine simillarity between the square and the emoji, we will compare the average color of the square and the emoji,
and pick the emoji with the closest average color.
In order to do so efficiently, we wouldn't compute the average color of all emojis each time,
but rather record the average color in the meta data and reffer to it while processing.

For starters, let's get the PreProcessor working, take a look at the file "pre_processor.py" to see what needs to get done.

After you finish writting, commit your work and push it back into github.
